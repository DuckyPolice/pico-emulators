# pico-emulators
a list of emulators that run off of an rp2040
DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THESE BELONG TO ME AND ARE JUST LINKS TO THEIR ORIGINAL REPOSITORY.
this repo is not meant to be cloned as it does not contain any code

# The reason for making this repo:
I have been very interested in fun things to run off of an rp2040 and i have collected my findings here.

# NOTES:
some of these are not emulators. it was just a general term i used and have no clue what else to call it so i just called it emulators.
